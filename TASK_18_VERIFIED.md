# Task 18 - App Installation ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary
Task 18 was already implemented! Here's what exists:

## ✅ What's Already Done

### 1. Post Creation (`src/server/core/post.ts`)
- **Updated** with Pixel Wars branding:
  - Title: "🎨⚔️ Pixel Wars - Team Territory Battle"
  - Splash heading: "PIXEL WARS"
  - Button: "⚔️ Join the Battle"
  - Description: "Claim territory. Dominate the canvas. Lead your team to victory."

### 2. Installation Endpoint (`/internal/on-app-install`)
- Creates a post when app is installed
- Initializes game configuration via `configService.initializeConfig()`
- Returns success/error status

### 3. Menu Action (`/internal/menu/post-create`)
- Moderator menu item: "Create Pixel Wars Game"
- Creates new game post
- Initializes configuration
- Navigates to the new post

### 4. Config Initialization (`ConfigService.initializeConfig()`)
- Sets up default game configuration in Redis:
  - Canvas size: 100x100
  - Credit cooldown: 120 seconds
  - Max credits: 10
  - Initial credits: 5
  - Zone size: 10x10
  - Teams: Red, Blue, Green, Yellow

### 5. Devvit Configuration (`devvit.json`)
- ✅ Triggers configured: `onAppInstall` → `/internal/on-app-install`
- ✅ Menu items configured: Moderator action to create posts
- ✅ Post entry point: `index.html`
- ✅ Server entry point: `index.cjs`

## 🎮 How It Works

### When App is Installed:
1. Devvit calls `/internal/on-app-install`
2. Server creates a new post with Pixel Wars splash screen
3. ConfigService initializes game configuration in Redis
4. Post is ready for players to join

### When Moderator Creates Post:
1. Moderator clicks "Create Pixel Wars Game" in menu
2. Devvit calls `/internal/menu/post-create`
3. Server creates new post and initializes config
4. Moderator is redirected to the new post

### When Player Opens Post:
1. Player sees custom splash screen with team stats
2. Clicks "⚔️ Join the Battle"
3. Game loads and calls `/api/init`
4. Player is assigned to a team and can start playing
