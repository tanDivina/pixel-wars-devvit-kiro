## 📈 Season Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    SEASON LIFECYCLE                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. INITIALIZATION
   ├─ Create Season 1 (or load existing)
   ├─ Set default settings (7 days)
   └─ Schedule end job

2. ACTIVE SEASON
   ├─ Players compete for territory
   ├─ Live countdown displays time
   ├─ 24h warning post (if enabled)
   └─ 1h warning post (if enabled)

3. SEASON END
   ├─ Calculate winner (zones × 100 + pixels)
   ├─ Save season history
   ├─ Post winner announcement
   ├─ Display winner modal
   ├─ Reset game state
   └─ Start new season

4. REPEAT
   └─ Cycle continues indefinitely
```

## 🏆 Scoring System

```
Team Score = (Zones Controlled × 100) + Total Pixels Placed

Example:
- Red Team: 2 zones + 50 pixels = 250 points ← WINNER
- Blue Team: 1 zone + 75 pixels = 175 points
- Green Team: 0 zones + 100 pixels = 100 points
```
