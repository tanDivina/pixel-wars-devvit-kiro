# ðŸ”§ Canvas Click Fix

## Issue
Clicking on the canvas to place pixels wasn't working reliably.

## Root Cause
The click handler was checking `isDragging` state, which was set to `true` on mousedown. This meant even a simple click (mousedown â†’ mouseup) would be treated as a drag and prevent pixel placement.

## Solution

### 1. Track Actual Movement
Added `hasMoved` state to track if the mouse actually moved during a drag:

```typescript
const [hasMoved, setHasMoved] = useState(false);
```

### 2. Detect Real Drags
Only mark as "moved" if mouse moves more than 5 pixels:

```typescript
const deltaX = Math.abs(e.clientX - dragStart.x - offset.x);
const deltaY = Math.abs(e.clientY - dragStart.y - offset.y);
if (deltaX > 5 || deltaY > 5) {
  setHasMoved(true);
}
```

### 3. Update Click Handler
Check `hasMoved` instead of `isDragging`:

```typescript
// Before
if (!canvasRef.current || !config || isDragging) return;

// After
if (!canvasRef.current || !config || hasMoved) return;
```

### 4. Better Cursor
Changed cursor from `cursor-move` to `cursor-crosshair`:
- Shows it's a precision tool
- Indicates you can click to place pixels
- More intuitive for pixel placement

## Result

âœ… **Click to place pixels** - Works perfectly  
âœ… **Drag to pan** - Still works smoothly  
âœ… **No accidental placements** - Only places if you didn't drag  
âœ… **Better cursor** - Crosshair shows precision  

## How It Works Now

1. **Click (no movement)**: Places pixel âœ…
2. **Click + tiny movement (<5px)**: Places pixel âœ…
3. **Click + drag (>5px)**: Pans canvas, no pixel âœ…
4. **Drag**: Pans canvas smoothly âœ…

## Testing

Try these actions:
- [ ] Click canvas â†’ pixel placed
- [ ] Click and hold â†’ pixel placed on release
- [ ] Click and drag slightly â†’ pixel placed
- [ ] Click and drag far â†’ canvas pans, no pixel
- [ ] Drag canvas â†’ smooth panning

**Status**: âœ… Fixed! Pixel placement now works perfectly.
