## üéÆ What is Pixel Wars?

Pixel Wars is a massively multiplayer strategic team-based game where players place colored pixels on a shared 100x100 canvas to control territory zones. Inspired by Reddit's legendary r/place, Pixel Wars adds competitive structure with team battles, zone control mechanics, and timed seasons with clear winners.

**Core Concept**: Three teams (Red üî¥, Blue üîµ, Green üü¢) compete to dominate a grid divided into 100 strategic zones (10x10 each). Place pixels strategically to control zones, climb the leaderboard, and lead your team to victory before the season ends!

**What You Do:**
- **Place Pixels**: Click the canvas to place colored pixels for your team (costs 1 credit per pixel)
- **Control Zones**: Dominate zones by having the most pixels in each 10x10 area
- **Earn Points**: Teams score points for zones controlled (100 points per zone) plus total pixels placed
- **Compete in Seasons**: Timed competitions with automatic winner detection and celebration
- **Coordinate Strategy**: Use Reddit comments to organize attacks and defenses with teammates
- **Climb Leaderboards**: Track your personal rank and your team's standing in real-time

## ‚ú® What Makes This Game Unique & Innovative

### üéØ Strategic Zone Control System (Core Innovation)
Unlike traditional pixel art games where you just draw, Pixel Wars features a **zone-based territory control** mechanic. The canvas is divided into 100 zones, and teams must control the majority of pixels in each zone to claim it. This creates strategic gameplay where coordination and planning matter more than random pixel placement.

**Why This Matters:**
- **Strategic Depth**: Controlling a single zone (100 pixels) is worth 100 points, making focused attacks more valuable than scattered pixels
- **Team Coordination**: Players naturally organize to capture and defend specific zones
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Zones constantly change hands, creating exciting back-and-forth battles
- **Clear Objectives**: Visual zone borders make it obvious where to focus efforts

**Visual Feedback:**
- Controlled zones display colored borders matching the team
- Animated pulsing effects when zones change hands
- Team indicators in zone corners show ownership
- Real-time zone control updates as pixels are placed

### ‚ö° Instant Pixel Placement (Technical Innovation)
Your pixels appear **instantly** on the canvas (0ms perceived latency) using optimistic updates. The game provides immediate visual feedback through:
- Hover preview showing where your pixel will be placed
- Contextual instruction banners guiding your actions
- Toast notifications confirming placements
- Sound effects celebrating victories

**Technical Achievement:**
- Optimistic UI updates show pixels immediately
- Server validation happens in background
- Rollback on failure (rare)
- Creates responsive, satisfying gameplay experience
- No waiting for server round-trips

### ‚è∞ Competitive Season System (Engagement Innovation)
**Timed seasons** create urgency and excitement:
- Seasons run for configurable durations (default 7 days)
- Live countdown timer with dynamic styling based on urgency
- Automatic winner detection and celebration
- Full-screen winner modal with confetti and trophy animations
- Canvas resets for fresh competition each season
- Season history tracks past champions

**Why Seasons Work:**
- **Clear Goals**: Players know exactly when the competition ends
- **Fresh Starts**: New seasons give everyone a chance to win
- **Urgency**: Countdown timer creates excitement as time runs out
- **Celebration**: Winner announcements make victories feel meaningful
- **Retention**: Players return for new seasons to compete again

### üí∞ Balanced Credit Economy (Game Design Innovation)
A **credit regeneration system** prevents spam while keeping gameplay engaging:
- Start with 5 credits
- Earn 1 credit every 2 minutes (max 10)
- Each pixel costs 1 credit
- Live countdown timer shows when next credit arrives
- Forces strategic thinking about where to place pixels

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Anti-Spam**: Prevents single players from dominating through rapid clicking
- **Strategic Depth**: Limited resources force meaningful decisions
- **Accessibility**: Casual players can compete without constant attention
- **Fairness**: Everyone regenerates credits at the same rate
- **Engagement**: Players return regularly to use accumulated credits

### üöÄ Performance Optimized (Technical Excellence)
Advanced rendering techniques ensure smooth 60 FPS performance even with 10,000 pixels:
- Chunk-based rendering with OffscreenCanvas
- Viewport culling (only render visible areas)
- Dirty-rectangle updates (only redraw changed pixels)

## üé® Canvas Rendering

The canvas uses advanced optimization techniques for smooth 60 FPS performance:

### Chunk-Based Rendering
- Canvas divided into 50x50 pixel chunks
- Only dirty chunks re-render when pixels change

- Reduces main thread blocking

### Viewport Culling
- Only visible chunks are rendered
- Calculates viewport bounds based on pan/zoom
- Dramatically improves performance with large canvases

### Dirty-Rectangle Updates
- Tracks which pixels changed
- Only redraws changed areas
- Batch pixel updates into single render cycle
- Uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations

### Zone Overlays
- Rendered on top of pixel layer
- Animated borders when zones change hands
- Team indicators in zone corners
- Subtle background tints for ownership
