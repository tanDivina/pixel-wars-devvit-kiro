## How It Works

### 1. Track Zone Changes
```typescript
const [previousZones, setPreviousZones] = useState([]);
```

### 2. Compare on Update
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  zones.forEach((zone) => {
    const prevZone = previousZones.find(z => 
      z.x === zone.x && z.y === zone.y
    );
    
    // Check if control changed
    if (prevZone.controllingTeam !== zone.controllingTeam) {
      // Show notification!
    }
  });
}, [zones]);
```

### 3. Show Appropriate Toast
- **Captured**: Success toast with üéâ
- **Lost**: Warning toast with ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Coordinates**: Shows exact zone location
