# Custom Splash Screen Guide for Pixel Wars

## Overview

The splash screen is the first thing players see in their Reddit feed. For Pixel Wars, we need engaging visuals that communicate the team-based pixel art battle concept.

## Required Assets

You need to replace these two files:
- `assets/default-splash.png` - Background image
- `assets/default-icon.png` - Game logo/icon

## Design Specifications

### Background Image (`default-splash.png`)
- **Recommended Size**: 1200x630px (Reddit post preview size)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency support
- **Style**: Vibrant, game-themed, inviting

### Icon/Logo (`default-icon.png`)
- **Recommended Size**: 512x512px (square)
- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Style**: Clear, recognizable logo

## Design Concept for Pixel Wars

### Background Image Ideas:

**Option 1: Battle Scene**
- Show a pixelated canvas with three colored zones (red, blue, green)
- Include pixel art elements suggesting a battle
- Add subtle grid lines to show the canvas structure
- Use vibrant team colors: #EF4444 (red), #3B82F6 (blue), #10B981 (green)

**Option 2: Team Showcase**
- Three sections showing each team's color
- Pixel art characters or symbols for each team
- Dynamic, action-oriented composition
- Include "VS" or battle elements

**Option 3: Canvas Grid**
- Large pixelated grid background
- Show pixels being placed in real-time
- Zone boundaries visible
- Team colors prominently displayed

### Icon/Logo Ideas:

**Option 1: Pixel Sword**
- Pixelated sword or battle icon
- Three colors (red, blue, green) incorporated
- Simple, recognizable at small sizes

**Option 2: Canvas Grid**
- 3x3 grid representing the zones
- Each section a different team color
- Clean, geometric design

**Option 3: Team Emblem**
- Three colored pixels arranged in a battle formation
- Pixel art style
- Bold and eye-catching

## Text Overlays

### Splash Screen Header
**Current**: "Pixel Wars"
**Suggestions**:
- "‚öîÔ∏è PIXEL WARS"
- "PIXEL WARS: Battle for the Canvas"
- "Join the Pixel Battle!"

### Splash Screen Description
**Current**: Generic description
**Suggestions**:
- "Choose your team. Place pixels. Dominate zones. Win the season!"
- "Red vs Blue vs Green - Which team will you join?"
- "Real-time team battles on a shared canvas"
- "Strategic pixel placement meets territory control"

### Post Titles (Dynamic per post)
**Suggestions**:
- "‚öîÔ∏è Pixel Wars - Season [X] is LIVE!"
- "Join the Battle! Red vs Blue vs Green"
- "Pixel Wars: Can your team dominate the canvas?"
- "New Season Starting - Choose Your Side!"

## Implementation

### Step 1: Create Custom Assets

You'll need to create or commission:
1. **Background image** (1200x630px PNG)
2. **Logo/icon** (512x512px PNG)

### Step 2: Replace Files

```bash
# Replace the background
# Save your new image as: assets/default-splash.png

# Replace the icon
# Save your new logo as: assets/default-icon.png
```

### Step 3: Update Post Configuration

The splash screen text is configured in your post creation. Update these in `src/server/core/post.ts`:

```typescript
// Example customization
const postConfig = {
  title: "‚öîÔ∏è Pixel Wars - Season 1 Battle Royale",
  splash: {
    header: "‚öîÔ∏è PIXEL WARS",
    description: "Choose your team. Place pixels. Dominate zones. Win the season!",
    buttonText: "Join the Battle"
  }
};
```
