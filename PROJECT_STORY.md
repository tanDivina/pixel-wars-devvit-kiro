# ‚öîÔ∏è PIXEL WARS - Project Story

## Inspiration

The inspiration for Pixel Wars came from the legendary r/place experiment on Reddit, where millions of users collaborated and competed to create pixel art on a shared canvas. I wanted to capture that same magic of collective creativity and competition, but with a twist - organized team battles with strategic zone control.

I was fascinated by how r/place brought communities together through simple mechanics: place a pixel, wait, repeat. But I wondered: what if we added more structure? What if teams had to strategize about zone control rather than just placing random pixels? What if there were seasons with clear winners?

Pixel Wars was born from this vision - a game that combines the addictive simplicity of pixel placement with the strategic depth of territory control, all wrapped in the competitive excitement of team-based gameplay.

## What it does

Pixel Wars is a real-time competitive pixel art game where three teams (Red, Blue, and Green) battle for control of a shared canvas divided into 9 strategic zones.

**Core Gameplay:**

- Players join one of three teams and place colored pixels on a shared canvas
- Each pixel placement costs 1 credit, which regenerates automatically (1 credit every 30 seconds, max 10)
- The canvas is divided into 9 zones (3x3 grid), and teams compete to control the majority of pixels in each zone
- A real-time leaderboard tracks each team's performance based on zones controlled and pixels placed
- Seasons run for a set duration, ending with a winner announcement and fresh canvas for the next season

**Key Features:**

- **Zone Control System**: Strategic gameplay where controlling zones matters more than random pixel placement
- **Credit Economy**: Prevents spam while keeping gameplay engaging with automatic regeneration
- **Seasonal Competitions**: Timed seasons create urgency and give teams clear goals
- **Real-time Updates**: See other players' pixels appear instantly as the battle unfolds
- **Mobile-Friendly**: Fully responsive design works seamlessly on phones and desktops
- **Team Coordination**: Players naturally coordinate strategies to dominate zones

## How we built it

Pixel Wars was built in partnership with **Kiro AI** - an AI coding assistant that helped architect, implement, and polish every aspect of the game. This was a true collaboration between human creativity and AI capabilities, showcasing what's possible when developers leverage modern AI tools.

**The Development Partnership:**
Working with Kiro was like having an expert developer pair-programming with me 24/7. I provided the vision and design decisions, while Kiro helped implement features, debug issues, optimize performance, and write comprehensive tests. The result? A production-ready game built in record time with quality that would typically take a much larger team.

Pixel Wars is built as a Devvit Web application using modern web technologies:

**Frontend (React + TypeScript):**

- React for the UI with custom hooks for game state management
- Canvas API for pixel rendering with optimized dirty-rectangle rendering
- Real-time polling for game state updates
- Responsive design that adapts to any screen size
- Custom components: Canvas, ControlPanel, Leaderboard, Tutorial, CountdownTimer, WinnerModal

**Backend (Express + Node.js):**

- Express server with RESTful API endpoints
- Redis for persistent storage of game state, pixels, and season data
- Credit regeneration system with server-side validation
- Zone control calculation algorithm
- Season management with automatic winner detection
- Rate limiting and validation middleware for security

**Architecture:**

- Monorepo structure with separate client, server, and shared code
- TypeScript throughout for type safety
- Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement
- Comprehensive test coverage with Vitest
- Modular service-based architecture (canvas, credits, teams, leaderboard, seasons)

**Development Process:**

1. Started with core pixel placement mechanics
2. Added zone control system for strategic gameplay
3. Implemented credit economy to prevent spam
4. Built real-time leaderboard and team tracking
5. Added seasonal system with winners and resets
6. Optimized canvas rendering for performance
7. Polished UI/UX with tutorials and visual feedback
8. Comprehensive testing and bug fixes

**Kiro's Contributions:**

- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Design**: Helped design the modular service-based architecture
- üíª **Code Implementation**: Wrote 2,000+ lines of production-quality TypeScript/React code
- üß™ **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suites for all major features
- üêõ **Debugging**: Identified and fixed critical bugs (like the useEffect import issue!)
- ‚ö° **Optimization**: Implemented canvas performance optimizations for 60 FPS
- üìö **Documentation**: Generated detailed docs, guides, and setup instructions
- üé® **UI/UX**: Built responsive components that work beautifully on mobile and desktop
- üîß **DevOps**: Set up build pipeline, testing infrastructure, and deployment process

## Challenges we ran into

**1. Canvas Performance**
Initially, redrawing the entire canvas on every pixel update caused lag. Solution: Implemented dirty-rectangle rendering that only redraws changed pixels, achieving 60 FPS even with thousands of pixels.

**2. Credit Regeneration Timing**
Calculating credits after page refresh was tricky - needed to account for elapsed time accurately. Solution: Store last update timestamp and calculate earned credits based on time difference on the server side.

**3. Zone Control Algorithm**
Determining zone ownership fairly when teams have equal pixels was complex. Solution: Implemented a clear algorithm that counts pixels per zone and handles ties gracefully (no owner if tied).

**4. Real-time Updates Without WebSockets**
Devvit doesn't support WebSockets, so real-time updates were challenging. Solution: Implemented efficient polling with optimistic updates - show user's pixels immediately while fetching server state in the background.

**5. Mobile Touch Interactions**
Getting precise pixel placement on mobile was difficult. Solution: Implemented touch event handling with proper coordinate transformation and visual feedback for selected pixels.

**6. Season Transitions**
Managing season end, winner announcement, and canvas reset without data loss was complex. Solution: Built a robust season storage system that archives old seasons and cleanly initializes new ones.

**7. State Synchronization**
Keeping client and server state in sync, especially with multiple users, required careful design. Solution: Server is the source of truth, client optimistically updates UI but always validates with server.

**8. Testing Async Operations**
Testing Redis operations and async game logic was challenging. Solution: Used Vitest with proper async/await patterns and mocked Redis for unit tests.
