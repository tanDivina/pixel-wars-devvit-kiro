# 🔧 Splash Screen Fix

## Issue
The "Tap to Start" button (or custom splash screen) wasn't appearing - the game loaded directly.

## Root Cause
We built a beautiful custom `SplashScreen` component but never integrated it into the `App.tsx` component! The app was going straight to the game without showing the splash screen first.

## Solution

### 1. Import SplashScreen
```typescript
import { SplashScreen } from './components/SplashScreen';
```

### 2. Add State
```typescript
const [showSplash, setShowSplash] = useState(true);
```

### 3. Show Splash First
```typescript
// Show splash screen first
if (showSplash) {
  return <SplashScreen onJoinBattle={() => setShowSplash(false)} />;
}
```

## What Players See Now

### 1. Splash Screen (First)
- Animated "PIXEL WARS" title with gradient
- Bouncing sword icon ⚔️
- Team standings with progress bars
- Active player count
- Total pixels count
- **"⚔️ Join the Battle" button**

### 2. Game (After Clicking)
- Tutorial (first time)
- Full game interface
- Canvas, leaderboard, controls

## Flow
