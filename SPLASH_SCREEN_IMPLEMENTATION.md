## Design Highlights

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Title**: Large, pulsing "PIXEL WARS" text
2. **Stats**: Two prominent cards showing active players and total pixels
3. **Team Standings**: Detailed breakdown with progress bars
4. **CTA**: Animated "Join the Battle" button
5. **Help Text**: Subtle icons explaining gameplay

### Color Scheme
- Dark gradient background (gray-900 to gray-800)
- Team colors for badges and progress bars
- Blue-to-purple gradient for CTA button
- Green accent for "Live Now" indicator

### Animations Timeline
```
0ms    → Loading state
50ms   → Fade-in begins
200ms  → Stats cards slide in
300ms  → Subtitle appears
400ms  → Team standings fade in
600ms  → Help text appears
1000ms → Button starts bouncing
```

### Performance
- GPU-accelerated animations (transform, opacity)
- Staggered delays prevent overwhelming users
- Smooth 300ms transitions for interactions
- Optimized for 60fps

## Integration Points

### API Endpoint
- **GET** `/api/splash-data`
- Returns: `SplashDataResponse` with team stats and active player count
- Already implemented in `src/server/index.ts`

### Usage in App
To integrate the SplashScreen into the main app:

```typescript
import { SplashScreen } from './components/SplashScreen';

// Show splash screen before game loads
const [showSplash, setShowSplash] = useState(true);

if (showSplash) {
  return <SplashScreen onJoinBattle={() => setShowSplash(false)} />;
}

// Show main game
return <GameUI />;
```

## Mobile Optimization

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile** (< 768px): Single column layout, full-width cards
- **Tablet** (768px - 1024px): Two-column stats grid
- **Desktop** (> 1024px): Full layout with optimal spacing

### Touch Targets
- Button: 48px+ height for easy tapping
- Cards: Hover effects work on touch devices
- Spacing: Adequate gaps between interactive elements
