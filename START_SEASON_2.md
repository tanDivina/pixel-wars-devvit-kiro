# Quick Fix: Start Season 2

## What Happened

When you tried to start a new season, it reset the game but didn't properly increment the season number. You're still on Season 1 with 0 minutes remaining.

## Quick Fix (Run This Now)

Open a terminal and run this command while your dev server is running:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/api/season/start-new-simple \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This will:
- âœ… Increment season to Season 2
- âœ… Set a new 7-day duration
- âœ… Keep your current game state (canvas, scores)

## Alternative: Use Admin Panel

1. Open `tools/admin.html` in your browser
2. Click "Start Next Season" (the simple button)
3. Done!

## Two Options Available

### Option 1: Simple Season Start (Recommended for now)
- Just changes the season number
- Keeps all game data
- Use this to fix the current issue

### Option 2: Full Season Reset
- Ends season, calculates winner
- Resets canvas, scores, zones
- Starts new season
- Requires a post ID
- Use this for real season transitions

## After Running the Command

Refresh your game and you should see:
- "Season 2 â€¢ 7d remaining"
- All your current pixels and scores intact

---

**Quick Command Again:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5678/api/season/start-new-simple
```

Run this now to fix the season number! ðŸš€
