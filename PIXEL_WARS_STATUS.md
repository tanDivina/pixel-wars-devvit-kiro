- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Performance**: Optimized Redis operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Client (React)
  ├── Hooks (useGameState, useLeaderboard, usePixelCredits)
  ├── Components (Canvas, App)
  └── API Calls (fetch to /api/*)

Server (Express)
  ├── Services (Canvas, Credits, Teams, Zones, Leaderboard, Config)
  ├── API Routes (/api/*)
  └── Redis (State persistence)

Shared
  ├── Types (Game models, API contracts)
  └── Constants (Configuration)
```

## 🎨 Customization Points

1. **Canvas Size**: Change in `DEFAULT_CONFIG` (currently 100x100)
2. **Credit Cooldown**: Adjust regeneration time (currently 2 minutes)
3. **Teams**: Modify team colors and names in config
4. **Zone Size**: Change territory zone dimensions (currently 10x10)

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Canvas updates use polling (Devvit doesn't support WebSockets)
- No subscribe button yet
- No achievement notifications yet
- Tests written but no test runner script configured

## 💡 Winning Strategy

This game is designed to win both hackathon categories:

1. **Community Play**: 
   - Massively multiplayer by design
   - Team-based coordination
   - Asynchronous gameplay (play anytime)
   - Creates natural Reddit engagement

2. **Best Kiro Developer Experience**:
   - Entire spec created using Kiro's spec workflow
   - Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation
   - Demonstrates Kiro's capabilities for complex projects

## 📝 Development Notes

- Built with Devvit Web 0.12.1
- Uses React 19 and TypeScript 5.8
- Redis for all state management
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
