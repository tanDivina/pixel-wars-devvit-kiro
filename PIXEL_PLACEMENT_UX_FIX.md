# 🎯 Pixel Placement UX Improvements

## Issue
Placing pixels on the canvas was unclear - users didn't know where they could click or what would happen.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Hover Preview ✨
**What**: Semi-transparent preview of where your pixel will be placed

**How it works**:
- Move mouse over canvas
- See a semi-transparent pixel in your team color
- Black border shows exact pixel location
- Preview disappears when you move mouse away

**Technical**:
- Tracks mouse position in real-time
- Converts screen coordinates to grid coordinates
- Draws preview overlay on canvas
- 50% opacity for clarity

### 2. Contextual Instructions 📢
**What**: Dynamic banner above canvas showing what to do

**Two states**:
1. **Has Credits** (Blue banner):
   - "👆 Click on the canvas to place a pixel for [Your Team]!"
   - Encourages action
   - Shows team name

2. **No Credits** (Orange banner):
   - "⏳ No credits! Wait [time] for next pixel"
   - Shows countdown timer
   - Prevents confusion

### 3. Better Cursor 🎯
**What**: Crosshair cursor instead of move cursor

**Why**:
- Indicates precision placement
- Shows it's a targeting tool
- More intuitive for pixel placement

## Technical Implementation

### Hover Tracking
```typescript
const [hoverPixel, setHoverPixel] = useState<{ x: number; y: number } | null>(null);

// Update on mouse move
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  if (!isDragging) {
    // Convert mouse position to grid coordinates
    const gridX = Math.floor(mouseX / pixelSize);
    const gridY = Math.floor(mouseY / pixelSize);
    setHoverPixel({ x: gridX, y: gridY });
  }
};
```

### Preview Rendering
```typescript
// Draw hover preview
if (hoverPixel && userTeam) {
  ctx.fillStyle = userTeam.color;
  ctx.globalAlpha = 0.5; // Semi-transparent
  ctx.fillRect(x, y, pixelSize, pixelSize);
  
  // Border for clarity
  ctx.strokeStyle = '#000000';
  ctx.strokeRect(x, y, pixelSize, pixelSize);
}
```

### Dynamic Instructions
```typescript
{pixelCredits > 0 && (
  <div className="bg-blue-500 text-white">
    👆 Click to place pixel for {team?.name}!
  </div>
)}

{pixelCredits === 0 && (
  <div className="bg-orange-500 text-white">
    ⏳ No credits! Wait {formattedTime}
  </div>
)}
```
