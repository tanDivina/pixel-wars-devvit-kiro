# 🔧 Blank Screen Fix

## Issue
After clicking "Join the Battle", the screen went blank instead of showing the game.

## Root Cause
The splash screen was hiding before the game data finished loading. The flow was:
1. Show splash screen
2. User clicks "Join the Battle"
3. Splash hides
4. Game tries to render but data isn't loaded yet
5. Blank screen!

## Solution
Keep showing the splash screen while the game loads in the background.

### Before
```typescript
if (showSplash) {
  return <SplashScreen />;
}

if (loading) {
  return <div>Loading...</div>;
}
```

### After
```typescript
if (showSplash || loading) {
  return <SplashScreen onJoinBattle={() => setShowSplash(false)} />;
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Flow
1. **App starts** → `showSplash = true`, `loading = true`
2. **Splash screen shows** → Game data loads in background
3. **Data finishes loading** → `loading = false` (splash still shows)
4. **User clicks "Join the Battle"** → `showSplash = false`
5. **Game appears** → Data already loaded, instant!

### Benefits
- ✅ No blank screen
- ✅ Smooth transition
- ✅ Game loads while splash shows
- ✅ Instant game when button clicked

## Testing
1. Refresh page
2. See splash screen
3. Click "⚔️ Join the Battle"
4. Game should appear immediately
5. No blank screen!

**Status**: ✅ Fixed! Smooth transition from splash to game.
