## 💻 Code Snippet Posts

### Post 1: Credit System
```markdown
**Behind the scenes: Credit regeneration system ⚙️**

Players earn 1 credit every 30 seconds (max 10). Here's how we implemented it:

```typescript
// Credit regeneration logic
const CREDIT_REGEN_INTERVAL = 30000; // 30 seconds
const MAX_CREDITS = 10;

export function regenerateCredits(
  lastUpdate: number,
  currentCredits: number
): number {
  const now = Date.now();
  const elapsed = now - lastUpdate;
  const creditsEarned = Math.floor(elapsed / CREDIT_REGEN_INTERVAL);
  
  return Math.min(currentCredits + creditsEarned, MAX_CREDITS);
}
```

This ensures fair play and prevents spam while keeping the game engaging!

### Post 2: Zone Control Algorithm
```markdown
**How zone control works 🧮**

Each of the 9 zones tracks pixel counts per team. Here's the algorithm:

```typescript
export function calculateZoneControl(
  pixels: Pixel[],
  zoneId: number
): TeamColor | null {
  const zoneCounts = { red: 0, blue: 0, green: 0 };
  
  pixels
    .filter(p => getZoneForPixel(p.x, p.y) === zoneId)
    .forEach(p => zoneCounts[p.color]++);
  
  const max = Math.max(...Object.values(zoneCounts));
  if (max === 0) return null;
  
  return Object.entries(zoneCounts)
    .find(([_, count]) => count === max)?.[0] as TeamColor;
}
```

Simple but effective! 🎯

### Post 3: Real-time Updates
```markdown
**Real-time gameplay with optimized rendering 🚀**

Pixel Wars updates in real-time without lag. Here's our canvas optimization:

```typescript
// Only redraw changed pixels
const dirtyPixels = new Set<string>();

function placePixel(x: number, y: number, color: TeamColor) {
  dirtyPixels.add(`${x},${y}`);
  requestAnimationFrame(renderDirtyPixels);
}

function renderDirtyPixels() {
  dirtyPixels.forEach(key => {
    const [x, y] = key.split(',').map(Number);
    drawPixel(x, y, getPixelColor(x, y));
  });
  dirtyPixels.clear();
}
```

Performance matters! 60 FPS even with thousands of pixels.
