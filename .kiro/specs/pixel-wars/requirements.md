# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Pixel Wars is a massively multiplayer territory control game built for Reddit's Developer Platform. Players compete in real-time to claim pixels on a shared canvas, representing their team (based on subreddit affiliation or user flair). The game combines asynchronous gameplay (place pixels anytime) with synchronous competitive elements (live territory battles and events), creating an engaging social experience that brings Reddit communities together.

The game is designed to maximize engagement metrics through competitive gameplay, community coordination, and user-generated content. It meets all Reddit hackathon requirements for polish, including custom splash screens, responsive design, leaderboards, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Requirements
